# rustnetworking

This is a broad networking crate for rust. 

## Scope
The final scope is not yet determined, but thus far is as follows

- [ ] RSA cryptography
  - [x] Confidentiality
  - [x] Authenticity
  - [ ] Conf. + Auth.
- [ ] Peer-to-peer networking

## Security
This is mostly a project for fun, this means the security is not at this time, or maybe ever, 
up to snuff. Perhaps it will be one day.

## Authors
At this time I (LoZander) am the sole author of this crate, though I have used external crates, 
the authors of which of which of course deserve credit.
